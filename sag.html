    “Since 1975, both the Chinese and Indian pangolins have been included in Appendix II
of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, to which an annotation was added at the 11th meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2000. This annotation established zero export quotas for wild caught Asian pangolins traded for commercial purposes. Despite these measures, both species of pangolins in India continue to be exploited for local consumptive uses and are frequently found in illegal trade, both domestic and international,” said Gajender K Sharma, India Country Director at World Animal Protection.
Professor David Macdonald, WildCRU, department of Zoology, University of Oxford, said: 
“Increasing demand driven by traditional Asian medicine is making pangolins a lucrative catch.  
“It’s easy to see why they are being commercially exploited, as scales from just one pangolin can offer a life changing sum of money for people in these communities, but it’s in no way sustainable. Wild pangolin numbers are beginning to plummet.
